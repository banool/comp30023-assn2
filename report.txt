There are 3 main sections of the post-execution performance info.
I will use an example output from an execution to explain these.

The first section is fairly self explanatory.
[first section]

The second section contains info from proc. On linux you can use the handy
/proc/self symlink to access info from inside the process instead of having
to use the appropriate thread id. This data is from /proc/self/statm.
Blah is blah
Blah is blah.
etc.

[second section]

This final section contains info from getrusage. rusage is, unfortunately,
fairly limited on linux considering many of the fields aren't maintained.
However 3 fields were of interest, specifically those holding the time spent
on the CPU in user mode, the CPU time in kernel mode and the max RSS (resident
set size) throughout the life of server execution.
